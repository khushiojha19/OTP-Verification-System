# OTP-Verification-System
A Python-based project designed to enhance digital security by implementing a One-Time Password (OTP) authentication system. The system generates secure 6-digit OTPs, delivers them via email, and verifies them in real-time to prevent unauthorized access.

Tools and Technologies Used:
1. Google Colab: Environment for writing and running Python code.
2. Python Language: Core programming for implementing the OTP system.
3. Random Library: Generating secure, random OTPs.
4. Input Validation: Ensuring the integrity of user-provided data.
